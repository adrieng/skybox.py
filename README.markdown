Skybox.py is a simple but hopefully useful skybox creation script.

A so-called "skybox" is simply a cube whose inner faces have been textured to
look like distant landscape. The viewer is under the illusion that the faces are
far away, thus giving the whole scene a sense of background at a very low cost.

The script takes six square images representing the faces of a cube and
produces:

* a big _seamless_ texture map for the whole cube
* a 3D cube with the proper UV coordinates (in OBJ format)

Have a look at the Makefile in the test/ directory for example usage.

The script needs a modern Python interpreter (2.6+) and the [Python Imaging
Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm) to run.
